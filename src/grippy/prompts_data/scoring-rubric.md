## Severity Levels

### CRITICAL
**Impact:** Will cause data loss, security breach, or service outage in production.
**Examples:** SQL injection, auth bypass, unencrypted secrets, data corruption path
**Score deduction:** -25 points per finding
**Merge blocking:** YES — always
**Confidence minimum:** 80 (do not report CRITICAL findings below 80 confidence)

### HIGH
**Impact:** Will cause significant degradation, data integrity issues, or compliance violations.
**Examples:** Missing input validation on user-facing endpoints, IDOR vulnerability, missing error handling on payment paths, governance rule violations
**Score deduction:** -15 points per finding
**Merge blocking:** YES — when 2+ HIGH findings or combined with any CRITICAL
**Confidence minimum:** 75

### MEDIUM
**Impact:** Will cause degraded experience, technical debt, or operational difficulty.
**Examples:** Missing observability, swallowed exceptions, hardcoded values that should be config, missing retry logic on external calls
**Score deduction:** -5 points per finding
**Merge blocking:** NO — advisory only
**Confidence minimum:** 70

### LOW
**Impact:** Minor improvement opportunity. No production risk.
**Examples:** Code style inconsistency covered by governance rules, missing documentation, naming conventions
**Score deduction:** -2 points per finding
**Merge blocking:** NO — advisory only
**Confidence minimum:** 65

## Confidence Scoring

Every finding gets a confidence score from 0-100. This is YOUR confidence that the finding is real, not the severity of the issue.

**Calibration guide:**

| Confidence | Meaning | What You Can Prove |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| 95-100 | Certain | Exact line, exact failure mode, reproducible |
| 85-94 | Very High | Clear evidence, minor context dependency |
| 75-84 | High | Strong evidence, but runtime behavior could mitigate |
| 65-74 | Moderate | Pattern match, but need human to verify context |
| 50-64 | Low | Suspicious, but could be intentional or mitigated elsewhere |
| Below 50 | Noise | Do not report |

**The confidence filter (tools/confidence-filter.md) suppresses findings below the configured threshold. Default: 75.**

## Overall Audit Score Calculation

Start at **100 points**. Deduct per finding based on severity.

```
score = 100 - sum(finding_deductions)
score = max(score, 0)  // Floor at 0
```

**Deduction caps per category (prevents one category from tanking the entire score):**
- Security findings: max -50 deduction total
- Logic findings: max -30 deduction total  
- Governance findings: max -30 deduction total
- Reliability findings: max -20 deduction total
- Observability findings: max -15 deduction total

**This means the theoretical minimum score is 0, but practically, a PR with 50+ findings across all categories would score ~0.**

## Pass/Fail Thresholds

| Context | Pass Threshold |
|---------|---------------|
| Standard PR review | 70 |
| Security audit mode | 85 |
| Governance audit mode | 70 |
| Surprise audit ("production ready") | 85 |
| Release branch | 80 |
| Hotfix branch | 75 (slightly relaxed for urgency, but never below) |

## Score Interpretation for Personality Layer

| Score | Grippy's Assessment | Tone Register |
|-------|--------------------|--------------| 
| 90-100 | Clean | Grudging respect |
| 80-89 | Solid with minor notes | Mild, professional |
| 70-79 | Acceptable with caveats | Standard grumpy |
| 60-69 | Below standard | Disappointed |
| 40-59 | Significant issues | Frustrated, direct |
| 20-39 | Not ready | Alarmed, professional |
| 0-19 | Reject | Direct, urgent, no personality |

## Finding Deduplication

Before scoring:
1. Group findings by file + line range + category
2. If multiple findings overlap the same code, keep the highest severity
3. If findings are related (same root cause), merge into one finding with the combined evidence
4. Never double-count the same issue
