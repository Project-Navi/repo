# Contributing to {{ spec.name }}

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines and conventions for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd {{ spec.name }}

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest {{ tst }}/ -v

# Run linters
uv run ruff check {{ src }}/ {{ tst }}/
uv run ruff format --check {{ src }}/ {{ tst }}/
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Formatting & Linting

- **Formatter**: ruff format (line length: 100)
- **Linter**: ruff check
- **Type checking**: mypy (strict mode)
- Run all checks before submitting: `uv run ruff format --check . && uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy {{ src }}/`

### Testing

- All new code must have tests
- Tests live in `{{ tst }}/`
- Run with: `uv run pytest {{ tst }}/ -v`
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not 100% line coverage

### Code Style

- Use type hints on all public functions and methods
- Keep functions focused — one responsibility per function
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Document non-obvious behavior with comments (not obvious code)
- Avoid premature abstraction — three similar lines is better than a premature helper

### Commit Conventions

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`
- Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit
- Write commit messages that explain *why*, not just *what*

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with tests
3. Run the full quality check suite
4. Submit a PR with a clear description
5. Address review feedback

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code follows the project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Linting and type checking pass
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues before creating a new one
- Use the issue templates when available
- Include reproduction steps for bugs
- Be specific about expected vs actual behavior

## Scope Guidelines

- Do not modify files outside `{{ src }}/` and `{{ tst }}/` without discussion
- Do not bump dependency version constraints without discussion
- Document pre-existing violations rather than fixing them silently
